# WPL-EXP-1-HTML-5-
The project shows how to use HTML5 to design and build a multi-page web gateway, using a real-world public transportation case study as an example. I learned a lot about how HTML5 documents are put together, what semantic elements are, and what vital tags are, such lists. We could construct tables, forms, links, pictures, and image maps.
